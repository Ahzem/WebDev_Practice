		<h2><i>Culture of Sri Lanka</i></h2>
		<hr>

		The country has a rich artistic tradition, embracing the fine arts, including music, dance, and visual arts. 
		Sri Lankan lifestyle is reflected in the cuisine, festivals, and sports. South Indian influences are visible in many aspects. 
		There are some influences from colonisation by the Portuguese, the Dutch, and the British. 
		Sri Lankan culture is best known abroad for its cricket, food, holistic medicine, religious icons like the <b>Buddhist flag</b>, and cultural exports such as tea, cinnamon and gems. 
		Sri Lankan culture is diverse, as it varies from region to region.</p>

		<h2><i>Languages of Srilanka</i></h2>
		<hr>
		<p><mark>Sinhala (also called Sinhalese or Singhalese)</mark> is the mother tongue of the Sinhalese ethnic group which is the largest in Sri Lanka. It belongs to the Indo-Aryan branch of the Indo-European languages.</p>
		<p><mark>Sinhala</mark> is spoken by about <b>16 million</b> people in Sri Lanka, about 13 million of who are native speakers. It is one of the constitutionally-recognised official languages of Sri Lanka, along with Tamil, which has its origins in South India.</p>
		<p>Most Sri Lankans can speak <mark>English</mark>, though of course, their brand of English may sound a bit strange at first. Some struggle with English and that is sometimes due to a lack of confidence. Just enjoy the experience, if you can learn a little of Sinhala. The Sinhalese will go out of their way to help you because you have gone out of your way to learn their language, their most cherished possession and symbol of identity.</p>
